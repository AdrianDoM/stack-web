# Accessibility

We believe online assessment should be available and accessible to all.

We have taken steps to comply with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> on www.stack-assessment.org ("the website") at most of level AA requirements.

This statement covers the website, and does not cover the STACK interface for teachers and students.

## Steps taken

The website

  * browsers tested on: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Internet Explorer,
  * resolutions tested on: common resolutions for laptop, tablet and mobile,
* can be navigated solely by keyboard,
* functions with most common screen readers,
* ensures all non-text elements have alternative text,
* has closed captions available with all videos,
* never uses colour as the sole means of conveying information,
* ensures a colour contrast ratio of 4:5:1 throughout the website.
