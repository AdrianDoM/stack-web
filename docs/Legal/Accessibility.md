# Accessibility

We believe online assessment should be available and accessible to all.

We have taken steps to comply with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> on www.stack-assessment.org ("the website") at most of level AA requirements.

This statement covers the website, and does not cover the STACK interface for teachers and students.
