<tbody>
  <tr>
	<td> <h4>Algebraic answers</h4>
	<p>Students can answer algebraic expressions, like \(x^2+y\), and answers are graded based on mathematical properties.</p></td>
  <td>  <h4>Separate validation and assessment</h4>
     <p>Answers are validated before they are marked, so that students are not penalised for poor programming skills.</p></td>
  <td><h4>Specific feedback</h4>
  <p>Students can be given automatic feedback that refers to their specific answer and mistake, as if it were marked by hand.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
  	<td> <h4>Random questions</h4>
  <p>Generate random questions so students cannot share answers, and can repeat questions as many times as necessary.</p></td>
  <td> <h4>Multipart questions</h4>
  <p>Write multipart questions with follow-through marking.</p></td>
  <td> <h4>Language support</h4>
  <p>STACK is available in most European languages and many more, including Japanese.</p></td>
