# STACK

STACK is the world-leading open-source (GPL) automatic assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines.

* Students type in mathematical expressions, and are not restricted to multiple choice.
* Separate _validation_ and _assessment_ with an emphasis on formative assessment.
* Random generation of questions.
* A wide variety of input types, including line by line working.
* Support for multipart questions.
* Support for scientific units and significant figures.

A [case studies](%CONTENT/2019-cate-case-studies.pdf) and a [flyer about the STACK project](%CONTENT/2018-STACK.pdf) are available.

In 2019 we produced a self-contained "Getting started with STACK" [guide](%CONTENT/2019-STACK-Guide.pdf) to authoring STACK questions.
