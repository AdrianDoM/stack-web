# Case Studies 2019

In 2019, a project was carried out to write a collection of case studies on STACK usage around the world. These case studies highlight the many different ways STACK is used in institutions around the world, how it is being developed and how it is being used to research into online assessment. The case studies were edited by Malthe Sporring and Chris Sangwin, and funded by CATE.  

The full case study collection can be accessed [here](%CONTENT/2019-cate-case-studies.pdf), and the individual case studies are accessible on this website via the navigation bar.
