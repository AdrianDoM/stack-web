# About the STACK Project

STACK is an assessment system for mathematics, science and related disciplines, designed to enable students to answer questions with a mathematical expression, such as a polynomial. Students are not limited to multiple choice.

Below is a typical STACK question. Note that the student's answer can be any algebraic expression, and that their answer is interpreted by the system before it is marked. This allows the student to confirm the answer is what they intended before being marked. Notice also the automatically generated feedback.

STACK uses a [Computer Algebra System](../CAS/index.md) to power the assessment system. The built-in knowledge of mathematics that the computer algebra system provides opens up entirely new possibilities to computer-aided assessment.

Primarily, STACK provides a question type for the Moodle and [ILIAS](https://github.com/ilifau/assStackQuestion/) learning environments. STACK can be integrated into other systems using [LTI](../Installation/LTI.md).

A demonstration server is also available:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo)

## Main Features

* Assessment based on properties, enabling "give examples" style questions.
* Randomly generated mathematical questions.
* Individual feedback and marking, based on a student's answer.
* Support for real mathematics models, e.g. SI units.
* Multipart questions with follow-through marking.
* Line by line reasoning.
* Available in many languages, including Finnish, Spanish, Swedish, Danish and Japanese.

## Who uses STACK?

STACK is used at a number of universities and institutions for online assessment. Some examples are:

- The University of Edinburgh, Loughborough University, The UK Open Universities and Aalto University use STACK on a large scale for their Maths and STEM courses,
- Physics Curriculum & Instruction uses STACK questions to accompany their Physics textbook,
- At Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, STACK is being used for adaptive exercises that guide students through complex tasks.

You can read more about how these institutions use STACK by reading our [Case Studies](CaseStudies/2019/index.md).

## Development

STACK is currently being developed by

* [Chris Sangwin](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~csangwin/) of the University of Edinburgh. STACK is the brainchild of Chris Sangwin.
* [Tim Hunt](http://tjhunt.blogspot.co.uk/) and [Tim Lowe](mailto:tim.lowe@open.ac.uk) of the Open University.
* Matti Harjula of Aalto University, Finland.

STACK is open-source and welcomes additions and improvements from its users. Please see the community page on our documentation for more information on contributing to STACK. Contributions can include adding features, submitting translations, sharing publications or reporting bugs.

#### Computer aided assessment of mathematics

STACK is based on over a decade of research and development. A summary of this work is available in the book "[Computer Aided Assessment of Mathematics](http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199660353.do#.UklVZtKSJuc)", by Chris Sangwin.
